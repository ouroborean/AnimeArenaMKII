## BattleManager: Server-ready game logic for the battle system.
##
## This class contains ALL game execution logic extracted from battle_scene.gd.
## It maintains the same public API surface that abilities, characters, and
## QueryContext use (all_characters, roll, request_message, etc.) so existing
## game scripts work without modification — just pass this as the `battle`
## reference instead of the old BattleScene.
##
## On the server: instantiate BattleManager directly and drive it with turn
## packages received from clients.
##
## On the client: BattleDisplay creates a BattleManager internally, connects
## to its signals, and renders the UI.

# Color-balanced bot drafting — shared by char_select_scene (live game bot
# teams) and test_battle_headless (training/eval harness).
#
# Drafting algorithm:
#   1. First slot is uniform random over the eligible pool.
#   2. After slot 1, score each candidate:
#        - No-color characters (e.g. Crona): inherent value 50.
#        - Otherwise: +100 once if the candidate has AT LEAST ONE color
#          not yet on the team (single flat bonus regardless of how many
#          new colors they bring).
#        - Then -50 for EACH color the candidate has that's already on
#          the team.
#      The single-bonus design is deliberate: it stops the picker from
#      undervaluing 1-color characters relative to 3- or 4-color ones,
#      which previously made nearly every team contain a multi-color
#      character.
#   3. Pick uniformly at random among the highest-scoring candidates.
#
# Color encoding (Energy.Type): 0=GREEN 1=BLUE 2=WHITE 3=RED. RANDOM (4)
# is intentionally absent — characters whose costs are entirely random
# carry an empty array `[]` and use the inherent 50 above.
